# Godot makes Pacman

“Simple” implementation of the classic ghost-chasing game using Godot Game Engine

## Why

The intention was to build a simplified version of the game that a simple *neural network* could learn to play, eventually adding the missing pieces (ghosts, energy dots, etc.) to develop a fully capable AI
